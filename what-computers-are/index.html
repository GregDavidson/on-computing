      <h2>Preface</h2>
			<p>
				As a Computer Scientist I'm relieved when people honestly
				declare that they don't really understand computers.  This
				relief is in contrast to my distress when I
				discover that someone I'm interacting with has a seriously
				distorted understanding of	computers.
			</p>
			<p>
				It would be useful for most people today to have a basic
				understanding of what computers are along with some basic ability to
				make use of them.  A few people may find themselves interested in
				knowing quite a bit about computers but not know where to start.
				Most people have notions of what computers are which are not true
				and get in the way of using them or learning about them.  This
				<em>Simple Note</em> should provide a solid foundation.
			</p>
			<p>
				I like to start with fundamentals whenever
				I undertake a new project, especially if I intend to go deep.
				This <em>Simple Note</em> is intended to cover the most basic
				aspects of <em>What Computers Are</em>, especially for someone who
				thinks they might want to go on and learn a lot about computers and
				computing.  If you want to master something you need to take
				the time to get clear on the fundamentals!
			</p>
			<p class="important">The interactive features of this <em>Simple
			Note</em> have only been tested with recent versions of Firefox
			and Chrome.  I apologize if they do not work with your browser
			yet, and especially if you get popup errors!</p>

			<h2> Part 1: Computers are a Collection of Switches </h2>
			<p>
				A computer is a collection of switches linked together to provide memory
				functions and logic functions. To understand computers you need to know:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li> What is a switch?</li>
				<li>
					How can switches be used to represent meaningful values?
				</li>
				<li>
					How can switches be combined to perform meaningful
					operations on those values?
				</li>
				<li>
					How can I organize values into information and operations
					which reliably and conveniently address my needs and
					desires?
				</li>
			</ol>
      <p> Part 1 looks at how switches store Bits, Bytes and Words. </p>

			<h3>So what is a Switch?</h3>
			<img alt="off switch" src="../Icons/cropped-off-switch.png" />
			<img alt="on switch" src="../Icons/cropped-on-switch.png" />
			<p>
				A binary switch is a two-position switch like the simple ones
				used to turn lights on and off.  We call it a binary switch
				because it has only two positions, ON and OFF.  You can use
				such a switch to represent any either-or kind of
				value.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are some possible interpretations we could give the switch positions::
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> ON = she loves me, OFF = she doesn't</li>
				<li> ON = it's raining, OFF = it's not raining</li>
				<li> ON = innocent, OFF = guilty</li>
				<li> ON = black-and-white, OFF = color </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				and so on.  We can freely choose either switch position for any meaning
				as long as we are consistent.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are some common interpretations:

				Four Bits is sometimes called a Nybble.  The joke may not be obvious
			  yet.
      </p>
			<p>
				Using a Nybble to represent the ten decimal digits is called
				Binary Coded Decimal or BCD.  BCD wastes six switch
				combinations.
      </p>
      <p>
		    When the full set of values in a Nybble is
				expressed using the sixteen numerals 0-F it is called base-16,
				hexadecimal or simply hex.  It's a matter of style whether we use
				upper-case A-F or lower-case a-f letters for the hex digits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more Bits, the more combinations, the more you can express.

          <br /> Still today, nearly all Input/Output operations are done in Bytes.
          <br /> That includes all traffic on the Internet.
          <br /> We measure storage in Bytes.

        <h3>How can switches be combined to represent meaningful values? </h3>
        <p>
	        One switch can only represent a choice of two alternatives.
	        Combining several switches lets us represent more choices:
        </p>
        <table border="1">
          <thead>
	          <tr class="table_header">
              <td> Number of switches </td>
              <td> Number of Combinations </td>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 2 </td> </tr>

            <tr> <td> 8 </td> <td> 256 </td> </tr>
          </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
	      Notice that each time we add another switch, the number of
	      combinations doubles, because we can have all the previous
	      combinations with the new switch OFF plus all the previous
	      combinations with the new switch ON.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Byte is the smallest unit of information which a modern computer can individually
        address and manipulate.  Getting at Bit(s) requires first accessing the Bytes
        which contains them and then extracting the desired Bit(s) using several
        operations slow the computer down.  Therefore when we want to represent some fancy kind of value we
        usually think about how many Bytes to use rather than how many Bits.

	        Because a Ki (often pronounced "K") is close to 1000, it is
	        treated as being roughly 1000 or a metric "kilo".  Similary, a
	        Mi is close to a metric "mega" and a Gi is close to a metric
	        "giga".  The terms megabytes and gigabytes are usually
	        shorthands for Mi Bytes and Gi Bytes.  This discrepancy has
	        lead some tricky memory vendors to sell their customers less
	        memory than they were expecting, i.e. to sell an actual
	        megabyte or gigabyte instead of the expected Mi Byte or Gi
	        Byte.

	        Early microprocessor-based computers, such as the original IBM PC were
	        designed to work with 8 or 16 Bits at a time. Most general purpose
	        computers and more recent PCs are designed to work with 32 Bits at a
	        time. Scientific computers and the most recent PCs are designed to
	        work with 64 Bits at a time. The number of Bits which a computer can
	        work with in a single operation is called its <em>word size</em>. Just
	        as it is more efficient for computers to work with Bytes rather than
	        Bits, it is maximally efficient for computers to work in units of
	        their preferred Word Size.

	        A computer with a smaller word size can simulate a computer
	        with a larger word size by performing more operations, so for
	        some tasks it will be slower.  It is particularly inefficient
	        for a computer to work with more memory than it can address as
	        a single word - the meaning of this will be made clear in a
	        companion <em>Simple	Note</em>.

	        Data is generally transferred among computers and between
	        computers and devices (mice, keyboards, disk drives, networks, etc.) in
	        Bytes, i.e. 8-Bits at a time.  Bytes are the universal coinage
	        of Input/Output.  Thus computers must <em>serialize</em> large
	        values and data structures into sequences of Bytes when
          performing Output and then reassemble or <em>de-serialize</em>
          those Byte sequences into equivalent values and structures
          during Input operations.  Sophisticated mostly-automated
          <em>serializing</em> and <em>de-serializing</em> schemes
          underly most computer networking and database operations.
