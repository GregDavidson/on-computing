What is Computing?

You may have been exposed to Computer Programming, whether in the form of the
current craze to learn /Coding/ or through a serious course of study or even as
your profession. If so, you probably have an idea of what computing is. It's
highly likely, however, that what you know is one or two of the weaker
[[https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/paradigms.html][Programming Paradigms]], and you've probably missed most of the really powerful
ones - especially metaprogramming!

I'm creating some materials for learning Computer Basics and Computing Magic at
/warp speed/. I invite you to study these materials for your own benefit and I
would be delighted if you were to help make these materials better!
