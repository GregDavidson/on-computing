* Dream Machines

I'm using the title /Dream Machines/ here to honor Ted Nelson's extraordinary
1970 book /Dream Machines/ which is full of ideas for revolutionary computing
devices which were at the edge of the /State of the Art/ in 1970 and which
remain unbuilt despite being well within the /State of the Art/ for at least 30
years now.

I will be including here some of the ideas from /Dream Machines/ along with
other ideas and systems from the imagination and early work of other seminal
computists.

It is our hope that this document inspire and support the development of some of
these Dream Machines. Ideally as many as possible and ideally with Free/Libre
Open-Source Software.

Here are some of our favorite Dream Machines. And we'd like to hear about yours.
Please feel free to contribute to this OrgMode document on our GitHub
